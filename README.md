# AlphaGammaSense-Emotion-Recognition-via-Frontal-Alpha-Asymmetry-and-Relative-Gamma-Analysis
Implemented a signal processing pipeline to classify emotional states using EEG-based frontal alpha asymmetry and relative gamma power features. Employed bandpower extraction and statistical feature analysis to differentiate valence-arousal states for real-time emotion recognition.
